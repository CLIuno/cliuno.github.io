## Motivation

We love Bootstrap, but being for long time and all website looks same, so we decided to create our own UI library.

Fundamentally, we believe that UI libraries should be:

 **Simple** - Easy to use and easy to understand.

 **Flexible** - Easy to customize and extend.

 **Lightweight** - Small in size and fast to load.
